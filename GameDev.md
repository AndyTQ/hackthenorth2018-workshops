## Game Dev: Intro to Unity
### Presenter: Adam Leung

**Target Audience:** 
- Programmers who would like to learn about the basics of using Unity to make games

**Suggested Prerequisites:** 
- Basic programing knowledge (variables, conditional statements, while and for loops)
- An interest in making video games 
- A laptop with Unity installed

**Workshop Goals:**

Give learners the tools and knowledge to create a working game in Unity. 

**Description:**

Learn how Unity's editor is structured, how Unity projects are structured, how Unity's scripting is structured, and how to use all of those together to create an idea. We'll go through a common sense approach of how to execute on the idea of making a 2D platformer, and how one can go about coding, debugging, and iterating on that idea.
